# MultipleLinearRegression_mtcars
This work presents a machine learning model that predicts the relationship between 𝑚𝑝𝑔 and other features in the dataset to determine how car design affects miles per gallon. 
Exploratory data analysis was performed using various plots. 
The multiple linear regression technique was used to develop the prediction model, and feature scaling and cross-validation were considered for a high-performance model. 
Two models were developed, one with and one without feature scaling, and their performance was evaluated on unseen data. 
The models had good R-squared performance, indicating effectiveness. 
Constructive criticism and questions are welcome, and readers are encouraged to try other feature selection methods.
